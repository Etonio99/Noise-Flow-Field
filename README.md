# Noise-Flow-Field

This project was made using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library and editor and is written in JavaScript. When run, this project will create a set amount of particles (500) that will follow a "flow field". The flow field is an array of vectors treated as though they were placed in a 2 dimensional grid across the window. The vectors are applied a direction based off of a random point from Perlin noise. These vectors slowly change over time. As particles pass through these vectors, force is applied in the direction of the vectors. As well, as the particles move they draw a white trail behind them, creating interesting shapes and designs.
